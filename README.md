1- Twitter acts as a Producer of stream of data and we should use api to access tweets from twitter here's we use #twitter4J

2- Spark Streaming(In-Memory real time distributed Computing Engine )
that will consume tweets when they arrived and represent them as batches to apply stateful transformation to update the old data with new information for each hashtag (count hashtags)

3- After applying transformation we will post processed batches to flask server to visualize data in real-time dashboard

4- Apache HBase acts as storage layer built on top of Hadoop File System with low latency access (read / Write ) because writing stream data to HDFS is a high cost operation
